# cv-people-detector
A project for detecting people in video data.

## Background 
Parks and other public organizations could use quantitative information about how many people utilize public spaces. Software for detecting people from video feeds could be used to count how many people use walking paths, sports fields, or public transit hubs. 

## Under construction...

We are hoping that this will be a collaborative project
so we will try to structure it in a way that makes
it easy to contribute. Some ideas for making this happen:
  * Follow Hitchhiker's Guide to Python [on how to structure the project](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/#structure-of-the-repository)
  * Document code and create tutorials
  * Use sphinx to generate documentation pages and [put them up on Read-the-Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
