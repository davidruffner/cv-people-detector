Software for detecting people from video feeds could be used to count how many people use walking paths, sports fields, or public transit hubs. \r\n\r\n## Under construction...\r\n\r\nWe are hoping that this will be a collaborative project\r\nso we will try to structure it in a way that makes\r\nit easy to contribute. Some ideas for making this happen:\r\n  * Follow Hitchhiker's Guide to Python [on how to structure the project](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/#structure-of-the-repository)\r\n  * Document code and create tutorials\r\n  * Use sphinx to generate documentation pages and [put them up on Read-the-Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)\r\n",
